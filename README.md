In this project, we will start with raw data that necessitates various ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using Power BI Desktop.
Initially, we will perform data cleaning and transformation tasks using the Power Query Editor to ensure the data is accurate and well-structured.
Once the data is refined, we will utilize Power BI to analyze the data make visualization, 
and derive critical insights that will support business decision-makers in making informed and strategic decisions.

### Steps to Complete the Project Using Power BI

1. **Load the Excel Data:**
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Click on "Home" and select "Excel" to import your raw data file.
   - Browse to your Excel file, select it, and click "Open."
   - Choose the relevant sheet(s) from the Excel file and click "Load."

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Go to "Home" and click on "Transform Data" to open the Power Query Editor.
   - In the Power Query Editor:
     - **Remove duplicates:** Select columns with potential duplicates, then go to "Remove Rows" > "Remove Duplicates."
     - **Change data types:** Click on column headers and select the correct data type (e.g., Text, Number, Date).
     - **Rename columns:** Double-click on column headers to rename them for clarity.
     - **Filter rows:** Use the filter icon on column headers to exclude irrelevant data.
   - Apply additional transformations as needed to clean and structure the data properly.
   - Click "Close & Apply" to save the transformations and load the cleaned data into Power BI.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Switch to the "Report" view.
   - Use the "Fields" pane to drag and drop data fields onto the canvas to create visualizations such as:
     - **Bar charts:** For comparing categories.
     - **Line charts:** For trends over time.
     - **Pie charts:** For showing proportions.
     - **Tables:** For detailed data view.
   - Customize visualizations using the "Visualizations" pane, adjusting colors, labels, and other settings.

6. **Extract Insights:**
   - Analyze the visualizations to identify key trends, patterns, and insights.
   - Summarize your findings, focusing on significant insights for business decision-makers.

7. **Save and Share the Report:**
   - Save your Power BI report by clicking on "File" > "Save As" and choosing a location on your computer.
   - If you need to share the report, publish it to the Power BI Service:
     - Click on "Home" > "Publish" and follow the prompts to upload your report to the Power BI online workspace.
     - Set appropriate access permissions for stakeholders.

### Tips for Success:
- Regularly save your work to avoid losing progress.
- Document each step you take in the data cleaning and transformation process for reproducibility.
- Focus on creating clear and insightful visualizations that effectively communicate the data story.

By following these steps, you can successfully transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and insights using Power BI.
